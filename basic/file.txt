To My Cherished Grandma
In the heart of every sunset glow, And in the whisper of the leaves, I find a love that's ever so, A warmth that never leaves.
With hands that hold a world of grace, And eyes that twinkle with delight, In every wrinkle, every trace, There's a story pure and bright.
Your laugh, a melody so sweet, A balm for every aching heart, In every hug, a love complete, From you, I never want to part.
You've weathered storms with quiet strength, And danced through days both bright and grim, In your embrace, I've found at length, A love that fills me to the brim.
So here's to you, my guiding star, My haven and my gentle tide, In every moment, near or far, Forever in my heart, you bide.
